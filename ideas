the info published for L fit should be very granular - it's not enough to just have 3 components of uncertainties 
The likelihood fit by Sebastian et al is good but still leaves some problems. Eg for combination with ATLAS results,

map the CMS nuissance parameters to the ATLAS ones
	modelling of nuisance parameters could be different between CMS and ATLAS
Need covariance matrix for every nuissance parameter


Use Conveno to combine likelihoods, and idea is to publish a convariance matrix for all the nuissance parameters
